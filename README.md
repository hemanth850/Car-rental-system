# Car-rental-system
Welcome to the Car Rental System project implemented using PHP and MySQL! This comprehensive codebase offers a complete solution for managing car rental operations, ensuring a seamless experience for both customers and administrators.

Our system incorporates the power of PHP, a widely used server-side scripting language, and MySQL, a robust relational database management system. PHP enables dynamic web page generation and seamless integration with the database, while MySQL efficiently stores and retrieves data, ensuring smooth data management.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the project, we have attached a detailed report. This report includes a Relational schema, which illustrates the structure of the database and the relationships between various entities. This schema serves as a roadmap for understanding how the data is organized and interconnected.

Furthermore, the report also includes run-time screenshots, offering a visual walkthrough of the system's functionality. These screenshots provide a step-by-step demonstration of different features, giving you a clear insight into how the Car Rental System operates in practice.

With this project, you can easily manage various aspects of car rental operations, such as vehicle inventory, customer bookings, rental pricing, and administrative tasks. Whether you are a car rental agency looking to streamline your processes or a developer seeking to enhance your PHP and MySQL skills, this project will serve as an invaluable resource.

Enjoy exploring the Car Rental System project and make the most of its comprehensive implementation, complete with the accompanying report, relational schema, and run-time screenshots.
